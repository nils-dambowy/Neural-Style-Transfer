# Neural Style Transfer using Deep Learning

## In this notebook, we implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm based on the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge.

See notebook for further explanations, for an example output look in the foler "Example Output", each number corresponds to the generated image after a number of optimization steps. The input/style images used are located at the root folder.
